# hello world!


Hello there. This is my first attempt to make a data analysis process! The whole process is quite simple: spidering data , analysizing data ,and finally get conclusion. Tools used in this project is Python and Excel. In order to master python as soon as possible, so we will use python more in this project. Well, because this is my first project and at the same time I am the newer of python, there will be a lot of bugs and flaws in the process . So, this project is just a attemptation involved less reference meaning. But truth is , which I believe , my second project will be better that could provide a good insight for readers. I hope that day comes soon!
